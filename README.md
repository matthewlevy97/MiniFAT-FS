# CSE303

This is a modified version of the FAT filesystem with basic functionality for creating folders, removing folders, navigation, and editing/viewing files.
The user can also dump out a single page in hexidecimal form as well as view file system usage statistics.

This program was created for CSE 303 (Operating Systems). Usage of this code is strictly prohibited without written permissions from the author of this project (Matthew Levy).

The current state of this project was done over the course of three days.  It is currently not 100% complete according to the requirements from "assignment.txt".
